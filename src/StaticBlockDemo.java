    * Static Block in Java
    * It is used to initialize the static data member.
*  It is executed before the main method at the time of class loading.
* If you need to do the computation in order to initialize your static variables,
*  you can declare a static block that gets executed exactly once, when the class is first loaded.
*  We canâ€™t access non-static variables in the static block.  A class can have multiple Static blocks,
* which will execute in the same sequence in which they have been written into the program.
